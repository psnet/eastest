EAS cli build bug demo
===

With **EAS build** on android when press "back" button and open app again quickly will be visible splash (loading) screen, but on **classic expo build** there is no splash screen on app reopening (apps are not really closed in both cases).

Envs
---

SDK: 43 (also same problem in SDK 42)
EAS cli: 0.37
EXPO cli: 4.13.0 (with older versions was the same)

Code
---

Example based on new typescript demo from `expo init`. In code there is no nothing special, it only using `expo-asset` module with `useAssets` hook to preload 3 assets (images).

Assets (images) have big size for better visible effect when starting app. Real apps where I first catched this bug have many small images (~50) so conditions are close.

Reproduce bug
===

To have two version of apps (with expo build and EAS build) on same device and switch between them need to do 2 changes in `app.json` file.

EXPO classic build
---

Just run `expo build:android`, choose type `apk` to build.

EAS build
---

Change in `app.json`:

- App name (line #3):
```json
    "name": "App build test EXPO",
```
to
```json
    "name": "App build test EAS",
```
- App package name (line #29):
```json
      "package": "com.easbuild.tests.expo",
```
to
```json
      "package": "com.easbuild.tests.eas",
```

Then run `eas build --platform android --profile development`

Install these APKs on device and test "back" button behavior: you will see that app created via EAS build will show splash screen on every app reopening where classic build - not.
